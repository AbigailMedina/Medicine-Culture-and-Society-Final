		['Tactile',"One example of AI using tactile input to gain intelligence is being tasked to walk. How does a human learn how to walk? First, a baby that is trying to walk has to be told that it should be learning to walk. This is equivalent to a computer scientist writing a program to tell a robot to walk. Next, both machine and baby have to fall and fail a lot. This is where the learning happens. A baby can't balance because it doesn't know that if it leans forward it will fall. The same holds for a robot. A robot has to make a decision to move as per the programâ€™s instructions and it will either fall or not. The program will maximize successful movements mathematically so that the machine can understand where it went wrong. Same thing happens with a child when it falls and cries or successfully takes a step and gets applause from its parents. "],
